### Introduction

This project was created to illustrate the Bulkhead pattern. Currently, it doesnâ€™t contain any functional code, but it provides an opportunity to learn a bit about the pattern.

### What is it?

The Bulkhead pattern is a design approach used to prevent a service from overloading the server and causing downtime. The name is inspired by the concept of a bulkhead in a ship, which is a compartmentalized structure designed to contain damage or flooding to a specific area. Similarly, in software systems, the Bulkhead pattern ensures resilience and isolates failures, preventing issues in one part of the system from affecting the rest. The Bulkhead pattern can be applied in various contexts: databases, microservices, endpoints, and any other scenario where it is necessary to isolate failures to prevent system overload and ensure resilience.

## Analogy

A simple analogy between a ship and the Bulkhead is:

Imagine a ship in a storm. If it has no walls inside to block the water (Bulkheads), the water can spread everywhere and sink the ship. But if the ship has Bulkheads, the water stays in one area, and the rest of the ship is safe. In software, the Bulkhead pattern does the same thing. It separates parts of the system so that if one part has a problem, the rest can keep working.

## When can I use it?

You can use it when your service has high processing demands and needs to isolate parts to avoid overloading the entire system. In this project, you can find an example of using this pattern in a very simple form. The code includes an asynchronous task pool where tasks are added to a queue and processed five at a time. The objective is to return an "unavailable" status when the endpoint "bulkhead" is executed five times concurrently. However, other system endpoints remain unaffected, ensuring no downtime for the rest of the system. Do you remember the analogy? Here, we are isolating only one part of the ship. This part can be overloaded without affecting the rest, keeping the service UP and running!

## When to use

- Improved system resilience: Isolates failures to prevent cascading issues across the system.
- Avoids complete downtime: Keeps unaffected endpoints running while others recover.

## When not to use?

- When an endpoint or task is not resource intensive.
- When complexity is not needed

## Examples of Architecture

The following example demonstrates how the idea was applied to an endpoint.

If we look at the image, we can imagine that each endpoint is like a compartment in a ship, and the service is the ship itself. 
This way, if one compartment fills with water, it won't sink the whole ship.

## You can execute the project with:

```shell
  docker compose up
```

- `npm run test`: It executes N requests to the `/bulkhead` endpoint.

## Endpoints:

- `http://localhost:3000/bulkhead` :  Simulates the Bulkhead pattern. You need to execute it multiple times to reach the limit.
- `http://localhost:3000/other`: When the /bulkhead endpoint is unavailable, this endpoint continues to work.
